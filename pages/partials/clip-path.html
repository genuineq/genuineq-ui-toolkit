<h2 class="page-title">Clip-Path</h2>
              <p class="info">The clip-path property in CSS allows you to specify a specific region of an element to display, with the rest being hidden (or “clipped”) away.</p>
              <p class="info">The most common use case would be an image, but it’s not limited to that. You could just as easily apply clip-path to a paragraph tag and only a portion of the text.</p>

<h2 class="page-title">Writing-Mode</h2>
<p class="info">The writing-mode property changes the alignment of the text so that it can be read from top to bottom or from left to right, depending on the language. For example, letâ€™s say we want to add some text that is read from top to bottom and from right to left.</p>
<div class="example-container">
  <p>This is text that needs to be read from top to bottom, and from right to left:</p>
  <p class="writing-mode-vertical-rl color-primary display-inline-block max-inline-size-300px ">This is text that needs to be read from top to bottom, and from right to left.</p>
